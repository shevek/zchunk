Description: compress a file into independent chunks
 zchunk is a compressed file format that splits the file into independent
 chunks. This allows one to only download changed chunks when
 downloading a new version of the file, and also makes zchunk files
 efficient over rsync.
 .
 zchunk files are protected with strong checksums to verify that the file
 downloaded is, in fact, the file desired.
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools.
